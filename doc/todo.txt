definite issue:
[X] S(hw) currently cutoff at 200 meV

Three main things:
[X] Hard coded numbers diamond but not necessarily for other
[X] Integration -> very slow but its not clear converging
[X] Input file -> easier to use (yaml)

[X] = Not done
[âˆš] = Done

Goals:
[X] CBCN or C2CN PL spectra
[X] Easier to use, eliminating hard-coded numbers
[X] Faster, right now 40 minutes, down to 1 minute?
